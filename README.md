# ESP8266 Flex Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a flex sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller to measure flexion and output the angle on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Flex Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard (optional)**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Flex Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - **Flex Sensor Pin:** Connect one pin of the flex sensor to the A0 pin on the ESP8266.
   - **Other Flex Sensor Pin:** Connect the other pin of the flex sensor to the GND on the ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Install the necessary libraries if required.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor.
   - You should see the raw sensor value and the corresponding angle printed every half second.

#### Applications
- **Human-Machine Interface:** Use the flex sensor for controlling devices based on hand gestures or movements.
- **Medical Devices:** Integrate into wearable medical devices to monitor joint movements.
- **Gaming Controllers:** Implement in gaming controllers for interactive gaming experiences.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the sensor based on your specific application to ensure accurate angle measurements.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure a stable power supply to the ESP8266 and the flex sensor.
